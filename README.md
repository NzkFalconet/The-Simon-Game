# The-Simon-Game
I made this simon game using javascript framework "JQuery" here i used HTML and CSS for Front-end and used javascript for functionality.
Logic:
I created two empty Arrays for user-clicked pattern and game-pattern . Then checked that if it's length and array are same or not , if they are 
same we proceeds to next level and change the title to level +(current level) ,otherwise we change the title to game over and restart the game.
